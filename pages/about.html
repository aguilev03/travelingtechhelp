        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          At Traveling Tech Pro, our mission is simple:
          <strong>to help others grow and move forward</strong>. Because with
          the proper support, we all go further together.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion for technology started in childhood, when I'd break the
          family computer and quickly learn how to fix it before anyone found
          out. That curiosity grew into a lifelong pursuit of understanding how
          things work and, more importantly, how to make them work for others.
        </p>

        <h2>What Sets Us Apart</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike big-box stores or faceless support lines, I offer personalized,
          one-on-one service. I take the time to learn about your needs and
          provide custom solutions that align with your goals and budget. I
          believe in turning complex problems into simple, understandable
          solutions and being someone you can rely on for all your tech needs.

        <h2>Meet the Tech</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a proud San Antonio native and a graduate of the University of the
          Incarnate Word, holding a degree in Information Technology. I hold the
          Google IT Support Certificate and have 15+ years of experience in help
          desk and personal IT consulting.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey into tech support began unexpectedly‚Äîafter crashing a
          computer in middle school, I fixed it on the spot. That moment sparked
          a passion I've followed ever since.

        <h2>Who We Serve</h2>
        <p>
          I love helping individuals, small businesses, and creators who want
          technology to work for them, not against them. Whether you're building
          a dream project or need your tech to "just work," I'm here to make it
          feel like magic again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm especially passionate about servers, Linux systems, and
          automation, which enable things to run smarter, faster, and more
          efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          I offer free remote diagnostics and stand by my work with a 30-day
          satisfaction guarantee.

        <h2>Values You Can Count On</h2>
        <p>
          I work with honesty, patience, compassion, and a deep respect for your
          time and trust. My goal isn't just to fix the problem; it's to leave
          you feeling confident and informed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most clients describe me as quick, understanding, and dependable, and
          I aim to live up to that every time.
