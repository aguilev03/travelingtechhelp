A slow computer doesn’t always need replacing. In a few minutes, you can clear clutter, reduce background load, and get back some real speed with no deep tech skills required.

1. **Restart your PC.** Clears memory and resets background processes.  
   [Microsoft guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/restart-reboot-your-pc-110262aa-fc79-1c33-7b00-c140ae3a6dac)

2. **Clean internet files (cache & cookies).** Helps pages load faster and frees space.  
   [How to clear cache](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/learning-center/how-to-manage-and-clear-your-cache-and-cookies?form=MA13I2)

3. **Remove unused programs.** If you don’t use it, it shouldn’t run.  
   [Uninstall apps](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uninstall-or-remove-apps-and-programs-in-windows-4b55f974-2cc6-2d2b-d092-5905080eaf98)

4. **Disable unnecessary startup apps.** Faster boot, less background noise.  
   [Manage startup apps](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configure-startup-applications-in-windows-115a420a-0bff-4a6f-90e0-1934c844e473)

5. **Consider a RAM upgrade (advanced).** If the PC lags with many tabs/apps open, more RAM can make multitasking smooth.

## When to upgrade RAM

If Task Manager shows memory near **80–90%** while you’re doing normal work (browsing, video calls, Office), an upgrade will likely help more than any software tweak.
